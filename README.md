## DISCRIPTION
```
A simple dice game. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "stay":

1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's      turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes    the next player's turn.
